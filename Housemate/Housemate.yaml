  Housemate offers multiple features that help you gain inspiration from other homes in XIV.
  If you're looking for a specific home or outdoor item, you can check the exterior list
  when running around a ward. If you're interested in seeing what items make up a
  structure in a home - turn on the item overlay to see what they are!
  
  Note: This plugin is purely informational, and does not assist you in placing
  or "glitching" housing items.
punchline: Displays information about housing fixtures and objects.
